- 👋 Hi, I’m @luanmxz
- 👀 I'm interested in posting my codes to follow my evolution, try to help others' code, and learn from it :D
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Django, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS and JavaScript and I intend to learn more frameworks and languages in the future!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that use languages and frameworks I'm learning and using.
- 📫 Contact me: luanmarcenemxz22@gmail.com (I'll answer you in less than 3 hours - *probably*)
